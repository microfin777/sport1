                            Not really that challenging for me, can't say the same for others but it's a decent manager game. There's a complex tactics feature which is good, fast (really fast) gameplay and simple yet nostalgic graphics. So, it's decent. 4 stars for now since I don't really like the fact that every game there will be at least 1 player who got red card, injured or suspended for getting too much yellow card (this one also happen to frequently) which makes this game not that realistic.                        </div>

                            I think it is a great game, it has a retro style like Win98 software. It should have a team history since the team was created in the past, and tournament history, a showcase for team and coach trophies, as well as a derby as a spacial match or activity, I think is important to see what happens in other leagues, match results, top scorers. Also importing league flags or emblems, it would be very good and would bring realism, as well as league trophies. thanks for your job.                        </div>

                            Reminds me of classic spanish PC Fútbol manager. I like its vintage feel. I don't like not having an option to automatically change your lineup when a player has to rest one game because of a red card or an injury, since changing it manually every two games or so ends up taking a good percentage of the time I spend playing. I hope developers implement something like that. Good job so far though 👍                        </div>

                            It's a good easy game to play and with more options it could be a 5 star killer game. Too many injuries and red cards during games. Players who are reserves lose level too fast. Not enough flexibility on formations, more options needed or create your own. I had two brilliant youths promoted on 5 Yr contracts but they left after 2 years in?. These things are crazy and make the game amateur. Minor updates like fixing these problems would make this a winner! Please consider! Also tried to export and edit the info but when the file opened it was only some spanish players not the whole thing as promised. Pointless exercise.                        </div>

                            Back to basic game which is great! Very addictive and can be a quick season which is good too! Only down fall for me, is when teams can buy your best player and then the transfer window ends before you can get a replacement! Would be good if there was a group stage for European games too! Other than that, love it!                        </div>

                            Excellent hark back to retro football management. Its excellent and no ads! I'd like to see more details added - negotiations, dealing with in game actions to influence results and more detail over man management and the opportunity to manage other clubs - that sounds like alot but in fact this already has the basis to become a classic. Add more features and I'd be happy to go 5 stars and buy it.                        </div>

                            Football manager sims are simple games and this title over-simplifies! Can't train players up, can't change players or tactics during matches... it really is just click next match, see the result, adjust the line up if there's been an injury or suspension and then click the next match. It will hold your attention for 5-10 minutes and then you'll uninstall it to look for a game with more options.                        </div>

                            I love this game definitely the best soccer manager game cause of the far access it permits you to your team and, it's offline.Not to mention every update leaves me eagerly waiting for another for the wide areas of the game they touch on.Though i would mention the save process being a drag. It takes the game, i don't know, minutes just to save;Opening the app is faster(enphasis) than saving.Do intervene please 'cause it's really stressing. Edit: After the discussion we heard, i stand corrected.                        </div>
